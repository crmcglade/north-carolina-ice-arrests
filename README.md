## How many people has ICE arrested in North Carolina?
The answer to this question is not simple. Nearly 20% of the rows in the ICE arrests database are missing values for State of Apprehension. So one cannot simply filter for North Carolina. For the rows missing state values, you need to use a combination of the Area of Responsibility and the Apprehension Site Landmark to find everyone.

This repo notebook goes through each step to catch as many North Carolina arrests as possible.
